# OctoCity
Octopus command line plugin for TeamCity. Useful if you want a bespoke octopus package process without having to include the nuget package in your source code.

## Downloads
Downloads are available, pre-packaged [here](https://github.com/herecydev/OctoCity/releases/).

## Installation
1. Download your selected package.
2. From within the administration panel in TeamCity, select "Plugins List" and then "Upload plugin zip".
  * This may require a restart of the TeamCity service, depending on version.
3. This can now be consumed just like a typical plugin.
